        Project description for pyHydraulic
        ====================================================================
        
        Create social share component pyHydraulic based on `github <https://github.com/nanjing-institute-of-technology/pyHydraulic>`_
        
        *************
        1.Get Started
        *************
        
        Installation is easy::
        
         $ pip install pyHydraulic
        
        
        Initialize the extension::
        
         from pyHydraulic import pyH
        
        ****************************************************
        2.Run the hydraulicSketcher to draw schematics
        ****************************************************
        
        
        Hydraulicsketcher is a tool similar to visio. It has been integrated in this package. Type the following code to call the tool independently.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from pyHydraulic.hydraulicSketcher import hydraulicSketcher
            hydraulicSketcher.run()
        
        Next, you'll see a software interface like this.
        
        .. image:: https://note.youdao.com/yws/public/resource/2d6ebb7e4e1aa8e32796b5917b780a8d/xmlnote/0EA04601A1BB4181A58FBAA9489DF7F1/41067
        
        
        The tool itself  has called the pyHydraulic package.
        There are still some functions to be improved for it.
        A tutorial on using the tool will be provided later in GitHub.
        
        *************
        3.Example
        *************
        For a period of time, I will give the instruction documents to
        teach you how to draw the hydraulic schematic diagram and load
        it in the interface of the measurement and control system
